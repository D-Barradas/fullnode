### bitcoin.conf configuration file for the Bitcoin #Fullnode Project: Not (Just) Made In China
## These settings are designed for the Raspberry Pi versions 2 & 3 see http://fullnode.protip.is for details
## Lines beginning with # are comments.
## Uncomment and edit options you wish to use, detailed guide here: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Running_Bitcoin

### Enable incoming data connections
## To ensure your Fullnode validates transactions it is necessary to have both ‘upnp’ and ‘listen’ enabled.
## Note that many users will also need to enable Port Forwarding on their home router.
## To do this: go to your router’s page e.g. 192.168.0.1 in your browser then choose Advanced Settings 
## Setup port forwarding on TCP/UDP 8333 to 8333 for the IP address of your Fullnode and Apply Changes
## If successful you will notice in time the number of connections increase above 8
## For more details see here: https://bitcoin.org/en/full-node#network-configuration
upnp=1
listen=1

## Use this for Bitcoin development and blockchain analysis
# Note uncommenting this line will make Bitcoin rescan the whole blockchain which can takes several days
#txindex=1

## Performance: Bandwidth and Memory usage
# Cache size in Mb for the DB. Lower is better when using Bitcoin with other apps running, default is 100Mb.
#dbcache=50

# Send and receive complete blocks only, no loose transactions. Uncommenting can reduce bandwidth by 88%
#blocksonly=1

# Max number of megabytes uploaded by node per day. 144Mb is 1:1 ratio with downloading 1 day of blocks
#maxuploadtarget=144

mempoolexpiry=72
maxmempool=300
maxorphantx=100

## Spam protection
limitfreerelay=10
minrelaytxfee=0.0001

## Maximum number of inbound+outbound connections
# Consider setting this to 20-25 if you have issues
maxconnections=40

## Data directory for bitcoin, Use for external devices or if not using the default directory
# sample datadir=/home/media/USB/.bitcoin
#datadir=

## JSON-RPC options (for controlling a running bitcoin-qt/bitcoind process)
# =1 tells Bitcoin to accept JSON-RPC commands so that your fullnode can be run as a server
server=1
daemon=0

# How many seconds Bitcoin will wait for a complete RPC HTTP request
# after the HTTP connection is established.
rpctimeout=30

# By default, only RPC connections from localhost are allowed. Specify
# as many rpcallowip= settings as you like to allow connections from
# other hosts (and you may use * as a wildcard character):
#rpcallowip=10.1.1.*
#rpcallowip=192.168.1.*

# Listen for RPC connections on this TCP port:
rpcport=8332

# You can use bitcoind to send commands to bitcoin-qt/bitcoind
# running on another host using this option:
rpcconnect=127.0.0.1

# Use Secure Sockets Layer (also known as TLS or HTTPS) to communicate
# with Bitcoin -server or bitcoind
#rpcssl=1

# OpenSSL settings used when rpcssl=1
rpcsslciphers=TLSv1+HIGH:!SSLv2:!aNULL:!eNULL:!AH:!3DES:@STRENGTH
rpcsslcertificatechainfile=server.cert
rpcsslprivatekeyfile=server.pem

### Network-related settings:

# Run on the test network instead of the real bitcoin network.
#testnet=1

# Connect via a socks proxy
# proxy=127.0.0.1:9050

# Select the version of socks proxy to use (4-5, default: 5)
#socks=5

# Use proxy to reach Tor hidden services (default: same as -proxy)
# See Issue 6 on Github for setup: https://github.com/MrChrisJ/fullnode/issues/6
#onlynet=tor
#onion=127.0.0.1:9050

# These are other Tor nodes that will help your node find peers
#seednode=nkf5e6b7pl4jfd4a.onion
#seednode=xqzfakpeuvrobvpj.onion
#seednode=tsyvzsqwa2kkf6b2.onion
# These lines help limit potential DOS attacks over Tor
#banscore=10000
#bantime=11

## Quick Primer on addnode vs connect ##
## Let's say for instance you use addnode=4.2.2.4 ##
## addnode will connect you to and tell you about the ##
## nodes connected to 4.2.2.4. In addition it will tell##
## the other nodes connected to it that you exist so ##
## they can connect to you. ##
## connect will not do the above when you 'connect' to it.##
## It will *only* connect you to 4.2.2.4 and no one else.##
## ##
## So if you're behind a firewall, or have other problems ##
## finding nodes, add some using 'addnode'. ##
## ##
## If you want to stay private, use 'connect' to only ##
## connect to "trusted" nodes. ##
## ##
## If you run multiple nodes on a LAN, there's no need for##
## all of them to open lots of connections. Instead ##
## 'connect' them all to one node that is port forwarded ##
## and has lots of connections. ##
## Thanks goes to [Noodle] on Freenode. ##
