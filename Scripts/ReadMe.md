# Scripts

1. [Install Bitcoin Core 0.14 on Raspbian Jessie](https://github.com/MrChrisJ/fullnode/blob/master/Scripts/Installing_Bitcoin_0.14.0.sh)
2. [Upgrading Bitcoin Fullnode to 0.14](https://github.com/MrChrisJ/fullnode/blob/master/Scripts/Upgrading_to_Bitcoin_0.14.sh)
3. [Install Complete Fullnode Software](https://github.com/MrChrisJ/fullnode/blob/master/Scripts/Install_Complete_Fullnode_Software.sh)

These are Bash scripts designed to automate the installation process. To use a script simply download it on to your Raspberry Pi and then run the following commands:  

```
sudo chmod +x Installing_Bitcoin_0.14.0.sh
```  
Then to run the file, type:
```
./Installing_Bitcoin_0.14.0.sh
```  

Users who own early versions of the Fullnodes will just need to upgrade using script 2.
